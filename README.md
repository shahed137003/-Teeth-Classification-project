# 🦷 Teeth Classification using Deep Learning

## 📖 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify different types of teeth from dental images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the goal is to build an accurate, robust, and scalable model that can assist dental professionals in diagnosing and analyzing various dental conditions from images.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **📊 Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - **Collect Data:** Gather a diverse set of dental images representing different types of teeth (e.g., molars, incisors, canines) and various dental conditions (e.g., cavities, fractures).
   - **Preprocess Data:** Perform image preprocessing tasks such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to prepare the data for model training.

2. **🤖 Model Development**
   - **Select Architecture:** Use a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, such as MobileNetV2, to leverage pre-trained features and improve classification performance.
   - **Build Model:** Design a custom classification model by adding fully connected layers on top of the base CNN architecture for fine-tuning.

3. **📈 Model Training**
   - **Train Model:** Utilize the training dataset to train the model, employing techniques such as transfer learning and regularization (e.g., dropout) to enhance performance and prevent overfitting.
   - **Evaluate Performance:** Assess the model using validation and test datasets, and analyze metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. **🌐 Model Deployment**
   - **Develop Application:** Create an interactive web application using Streamlit to allow users to upload dental images and receive predictions on the type and condition of the teeth.
   - **Deploy Model:** Host the web application on a cloud platform to make it accessible to dental professionals for real-time analysis.

5. **📚 Documentation and Reporting**
   - **Document Process:** Provide detailed documentation of the data collection, preprocessing steps, model architecture, training process, and evaluation results.
   - **Report Findings:** Summarize the project outcomes, including the model's performance metrics, application features, and potential areas for improvement.
